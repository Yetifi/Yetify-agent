## 🚀 Overview

**Yetify** is an AI-powered, multi-chain yield optimization agent that autonomously scouts, evaluates, and reallocates assets to the best opportunities across DeFi.  
Think of it as a **tireless Yeti** navigating treacherous yield peaks—continuously hunting for the highest returns while you sleep.

Built for both **DeFi power users** and **developers**, Yetify combines **AI agents**, **real-time market intelligence**, and **secure cross-chain execution** to deliver a seamless, automated yield experience.
